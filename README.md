# Coffee Machine

A program to simulate the working of a coffee machine

Completed as part of the **Hyperskill JetBrains Academy Java Developer Track**.

Difficulty: Beginner

### Features
* Highly modular with classes for ingredients and (menu) items to allow for simulations of other machines (like a vending machine) or even a restaurant
* Validation of user input at every point (*obviously included but it took me time so I'm mentioning it!*)

### Demonstration

The coffee machine has/stores:

* A number of ingredients to make an items
* The amounts received by purchases of items
* The items that it can make

Each item has/stores:

* The ingredients and amount required to make it
* The cost of the item

Following operations allowed on/by the coffee machine:

* Buy items from the machine
* Replenish the ingredients in the machine
* Take the money stored in the machine
* Display the available ingredients and their amounts
